PROBLEM:

Given a number N, find if it is Disarium or not. A number is called Disarium if sum of its digits powered with their respective positions is equal to the number itself. Output 1 if it's Disarium, and 0 if not.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 89
Output:
1
Explanation:
8^1+9^2 = 89 thus output is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 81
Output:
0
Explanation:
8^1+1^2 = 9 thus output is 0. 
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isDisarium() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 108



SOLUTION:

JAVA CODE:


//User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    static int isDisarium(int N) {
        // code here
        
        int n=N,sum=0;
        int index=String.valueOf(N).length();
        while(n>0)
        {
            sum=sum+(int)(Math.pow((n%10),index--));
            n=n/10;
            
        }
        return sum==N?1:0;
        
    }
};
