PROBLEM:


Check if a given number N is the Fibonacci number. A Fibonacci number is a number that occurs in the Fibonacci series.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 34
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
34 is one of the numbers 
of the Fibonacci series.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 41
Output:
No
Explanation:
41 is one of the numbers 
of the Fibonacci series.
 

 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function checkFibonacci() which takes an integer N and returns a string "Yes" if it is a Fibonacci number else "No".

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100



SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:


//User function Template for Java
class Solution{
    static String checkFibonacci(int n){
        // code here
        
       int k1 = 5*n*n+4, k2 = 5*n*n-4;
    int sq1 = (int)Math.sqrt(k1), sq2 = (int)Math.sqrt(k2);
    if(sq1*sq1 == k1 || sq2*sq2 == k2)
    return "Yes";
    return "No";
        
    }
}
