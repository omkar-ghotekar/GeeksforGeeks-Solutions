PROBLEM:


Given an integer N, write a program to find the oneâ€™s complement of the integer.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
2
Explanation:
binary of 5 is 101
1's complement of 101 is 010
010 is 2 in its decimal form. 
Example 2:

Input:
N = 255
Output:
0
Explanation:
binary of 255 is 1111 1111
1's complement of 1111 1111 is
0000 0000 which is 0 in its decimal form.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function onesComplement() which takes an integer N as input parameter and returns an integer value, the one's complement of N.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106


SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:


//User function Template for Java
class Solution{
    static int onesComplement(int n){
      int bits = (int) Math.floor(Math.log(n)/Math.log(2)+1);
      return ((1<<bits)-1)^n;
    }
}
