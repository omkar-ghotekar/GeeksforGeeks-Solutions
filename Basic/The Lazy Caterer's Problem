PROBLEM:

Given an integer n, denoting the number of cuts that can be made on a pancake, find the maximum number of pieces that can be formed by making n cuts.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 5
Output: 16
Explanation:  16 pieces can be formed by
making 5 cuts.
Example 2:

Input: N = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 pieces can be formed by 
making 3 cuts.
 

Your Task: 
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maximum_Cuts() which takes n as input parameter and returns the maximum number of pieces that can be formed by making n cuts.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10000


SOLUTION:

JAVA CODE:

//User function Template for Java

class Solution
{
    public int maximum_Cuts(int n)
    {
        // code here
        return (n * ( n + 1)) / 2 + 1; 
    }
}
