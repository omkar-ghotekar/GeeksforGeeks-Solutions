PROBLEM:


Given N, check whether it is a Narcissistic number or not.

Note: Narcissistic Number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 407
Output:
1
Explanation:
43+03+73 = 64+0+343 
= 407 equals to N.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 111
Output:
0
Explanation:
13+13+13 = 1+1+1
= 3 not equals to N.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isNarcissistic() which takes an integer N as input parameters and returns an integer, 1 if N is a narcissistic number or 0 otherwise.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105


SOLUTION:


CPP CODE:



class Solution{
public:
    int isNarcissistic(int N){
        // code here
        int a,digit=ceil(log10(N)),n1=N,sum=0;
while(N)
{
a=N%10;
sum+=pow(a,digit);
N=N/10;

}
return n1==sum;
    }
};
