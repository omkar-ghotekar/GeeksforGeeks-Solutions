PROBLEM:



Given a singly linked list with N nodes and a number X. The task is to find the node at the given index (X)(1 based index) of linked list. 

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains space seperated two integers, length of linked list and X.

Output:
For each testcase, there will be single line of output containing data at Xth node.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function GetNth() which takes head reference and index as arguments and should return the data at Xth position in the linked list.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 30
1 <= N <= 100
K <= N
1 <= value <= 103

Example:
Input:
2
6 5
1 2 3 4 657 76
10 2
8 7 10 8 6 1 20 91 21 2

Output:
657
7

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Element at 5th index in the linked list is 657 (1-based indexing).



SOLUTION:

JAVA CODE:



class GfG
{
   
    public static int getNth(Node node, int ind)
    {
       //Your code here
       
       
       Node temp=node;
       int i=1;
       int n=0;
       while(temp!=null)
       {
           if(i==ind)
           {
               n=temp.data;
               break;
           }
           i++;
           
           temp=temp.next;
       }
       return n;
    }
}
