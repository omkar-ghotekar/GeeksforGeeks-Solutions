PROBLEM:-

Given an array Arr[] of N integers.Find the sum of values of even and odd index positions separately.

Example 1:

Input:
N=5
Arr={1,2,3,4,5}
Output:
9 6
Explanation:
The sum of elements at odd places i.e
at 1st,3rd and 5th places are (1+3+5=9)
Similarly,the sum of elements at even 
places i.e. at 2nd and 4th places are
(2+4=6).
Example 2:

Input:
N=5
Arr={1,1,1,1,1}
Output:
3 2
Explanation:
The sum of elements at odd places
is (1+1+1=3).Similarly, the sum of
elements at even places is (1+1=2)

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your Task is to complete the function EvenOddSum() which takes an integer N and an array Arr as input parameters and returns the sum of elements in odd places and in even places separately.
 

Expected Time Complexity:O(N)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Constraints:
1<=N<=105
0<=Arr[i]<=104,for 0<=i



SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:


// User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    ArrayList<Integer> EvenOddSum(int N, int Arr[]) {
        // code here
        ArrayList<Integer> list=new ArrayList<Integer>();
        //ArrayList<Integer> odd=new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        int sum1=0,sum2=0;
        for(int i=0;i<N;i=i+2)
        {
           sum1=sum1+Arr[i];
        }
        for(int j=1;j<N;j=j+2)
        {
            sum2=sum2+Arr[j];
        }
        list.add(sum1);
        list.add(sum2);
        return list;
    }
}
