PROBLEM:


Given two numbers A and B and task is to check whether A is greater than or less than or equals to B.

 

Example 1:

Input:
A = 2, B = 5
Output:
2 is less than 5
Explanation:
The output is self- 
explanatory.
 

Example 2:

Input:
A = 6, B = 3
Output:
6 is greater than 3
Explanation:
The output is self- 
explanatory.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function compareNum() which takes two integers A and B, if

If A > B then print "A is greater than B" without quotes
If A < B then print "A is less than B" without quotes
if A = B then print "A is equals to B" without quotes.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1<=A<=10000
1<=B<=10000



SOLUTION:


CPP CODE:


class Solution{   
public:
    string compareNum(int A,int B){
        // code here 
        
        string s = "";
    if(A>B){
        printf("%d is greater than %d",A,B);
    }else
   if(A<B){
        printf("%d is less than %d",A,B);
    }else{
        printf("%d is equals to %d",A,B);
    }
    return s;
        
    }
};
