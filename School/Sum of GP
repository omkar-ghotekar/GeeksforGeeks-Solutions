PROBLEM:


Given n, a and r as the number of terms, first term and common ratio respectively of an Geometric Progression Series. Find the sum of the series upto nth term.
 

Example 1:

Input: 3 3 2
Output: 21
Explanation: Series upto 3td term is
3 6 12, so sum will be 21.

Example 2:

Input: 3 1 2
Output: 7
Example: Series upto 3rd term is 
1 2 4, so sum will be 7.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sum_of_gp() which takes n, a and r as input parameter and returns the sum of the series.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constranits:
1 <= n, a, r <= 10



SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:

//User function Template for Java

class Solution
{
    public long sum_of_gp(long n, long a, long r)
    {
        // Code here
        long sum=0;
        
        if(r==1)
        {
            sum=a*n;
        }
        else
        {
            sum=(long)(a*(1-Math.pow(r,n))/(1-r));
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
