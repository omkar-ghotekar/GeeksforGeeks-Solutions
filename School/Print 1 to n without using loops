PROBLEM:



You are given an integer N. Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
1 2 3 4 5
Explanation:
We have to print numbers from 1 to 5.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Explanation:
We have to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input. Your task is to complete the function printTillN() which takes an integer N as an input parameter and print numbers from 1 to N space-separated integers without the help of loops.
Note: print newline character at the end.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000



SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:



//User function Template for Java
class Solution{
    static void printTillN(int N){
        // code here
        int i=1;
        if(N==0)
       {
           return;
       }
        
        printTillN(N-1);
        System.out.print(N+" ");
        
    }
}
