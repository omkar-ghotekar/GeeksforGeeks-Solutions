PROBLEM:


Given a string, remove spaces from it. 

Example 1:

Input:
S = "geeks  for geeks"
Output: geeksforgeeks
Explanation: All the spaces have been 
removed.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
S = "    g f g"
Output: gfg
Explanation: All the spaces including
the leading ones have been removed.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function modify() which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string by removing all the white spaces from S.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105

 
 
 
 SOLUTION:
 
 
 JAVA CODE:
 
 
 //User function Template for Java
class Solution
{
   
    String modify(String S)
    {
        // your code here
        StringBuilder str=new StringBuilder();
        for(char c: S.toCharArray())
        {
            if(!Character.isWhitespace(c))
            {
                str.append(c);
            }
        }
        return str.toString();
    }
}
