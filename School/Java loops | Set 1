PROBLEM:


For a given N, prints the sum of even and odd integers of the first N natural numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1
Output:
0 1
Explanation:
Natural numbers less than 1 are only 1.
So the sum of even number = 0.
and the sum of odd number = 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 6
Output:
12 9  
Explanation:
Natural numbers less than 6 are 
1 2 3 4 5 6
So the sum of even number = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.
and the sum of odd number = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getSum() which takes an integer N as input parameter and return the sum of even and odd natural number less than equal to N.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints: 
1<= N <=104



SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:


//User function Template for Java
class Solution{
    static ArrayList<Integer> getSum(int N){
        // code here
        
        ArrayList<Integer> list=new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        int sum1=0,sum2=0;
        for(int i=0;i<=N;i++)
        {
            if(i%2==1)
            {
                sum1=sum1+i;
            }
            else
            {
                sum2=sum2+i;
            }
        }
        list.add(sum2);
        list.add(sum1);
        
        return list;
        
    }
}
