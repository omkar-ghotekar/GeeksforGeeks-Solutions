PROBLEM:


Given an array arr[] of N integers, calculate the median
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 5
arr[] = 90 100 78 89 67
Output: 89
Explanation: After sorting the array 
middle element is the median 

Example 2:

Input: N = 4
arr[] = 56 67 30 79â€‹
Output: 61
Explanation: In case of even number of 
elemebts average of two middle elements 
is the median

 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function find_median() which takes the array as input parameter and returns the floor value of the median.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n * log(n))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= Length of Array <= 100
1 <= Elements of Array <= 100


SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:


class Solution
{
    public int find_fact(int[] v)
    {
    Arrays.sort(v);
    int n = v.length;
    if(n%2 != 0) return (int)(v[n/2]);
    else return (int)(v[(n-1)/2] + v[n/2]) / 2;
    }
}
