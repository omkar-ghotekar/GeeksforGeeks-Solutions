PROBLEM:


Given two numbers A and B. Perform addition,multiplication, subtraction and division on these two numbers.

Example 1:

Input: A = 1,  B = 2
Output: 3 2 1 2
Explanation:
A + B = 3
A * B = 2
Since B>A, therefore the result of
subtraction and division are
B - A = 1 and B / A = 2 respectively.
Example 2:

Input: A = 5 B = 7
Output: 12 35 2 1
Explanation:
A + B = 12
A * B=35
Since B>A, therefore results of subtraction
and division are B - A = 2 and B / A = 1.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function cppOperator() which takes two integers A and B as input parameters and returns a vector containing the results of addition,multiplication,subtraction and division of the two numbers.

Expected Time Complexity:O(1)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= A,B <= 10000



SOLUTION:


CPP CODE:


class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> cppOperators(int A, int B) {
        // code here
        vector<int> res;
        res.push_back(A+B);
        res.push_back(A*B);
        if(B>A)
        {
            res.push_back(B-A);
            res.push_back(B/A);
            
        }
        else
        {
            res.push_back(A-B);
            res.push_back(A/B);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
