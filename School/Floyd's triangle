PROBLEM:


Given a number N. The task is to print Floyd's triangle with N lines.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4

Output:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10

Explanation:
For N = 4 there are 4 rows in the output
and the number of elements increases 
with an increase in the row.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5

Output:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15

Explanation:
For N = 5 there are 5 rows in the output
and the number of elements increases 
with an increase in the row.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input. Your task is to complete the function printFloydTriangle() which takes an integer N as input parameter and prints the triangle.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100



SOLUTION:


C++ CODE:


class Solution
{
public:
    void printFloydTriangle(int N)
{
int a=1;
for(int i=1;i<=N;i++)
{
for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
{
printf("%d ",a);
a++;
}
printf("\n");
}
}
};
