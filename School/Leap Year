PROBLEM:


For an input year N, find whether the year is a leap or not. 
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Output:
1
Explanation:
4 is not divisible by 100
and is divisible by 4 so its
a leap year
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2021
Output:
0
Explanation:
2021 is not divisible by 100
and is also not divisible by 4
so its not a leap year

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isLeap() which takes an integer N as input parameter and returns 1 is N is a leap year and 0 otherwise.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


Constraints:
1<=N<=9999



SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:


//User function Template for Java

class Solution{
    static int isLeap(int n){
        //code here
        if(n%100==0) n=n/100;
        if(n%4==0)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
