PROBLEM:


Given a positive integer N, The task is to find if it is a power of eight or not.

Example 1: 

Input: 64
Output: Yes
Explanation: 64 is power of 8.
Example 2:

Input: 75
Output: No
Explanation: 75 is not a power of 8.

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. your task is to complete the function is_power_of_eight() which takes N as the input parameter and returns "Yes" if N is power of eight otherwise returns "No"(Wihtout quotes).

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1018


SOLUTION:


CPP CODE:



class Solution {
public:
    string is_power_of_eight(long long int n ) 
    {
       for(int i=0;i<100;i++)
        {
        if(pow(8,i)==n)
        {
        return "Yes";
        }
        }
        return "No";
            }
};
