PROBLEM:

Given only a pointer to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list. Print the whole Linked List after deletion.

Input:
The first line of input contains an element T, denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers N denoting the no of elements of the linked list and P denoting the number of the node which is to be deleted (starting from 0) . Then in the next line are N space separated values of the linked list.

Output:
The output for each test case will be the space separated elements of the updated linked list.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
2<=N<=103
0<=P<(N-1)
Example(To be used only for expected output):

Input:
2
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
4 0
1 3 6 9

Output:
1 2 4 5
3 6 9



SOLUTION:


JAVA CODE:


//User function Template for Java
class GfG{
    void deleteNode(Node node) {
        //Add your code here
        Node temp=node;
        node.data=temp.next.data;
        node.next=temp.next.next;
        
        
 
    }
}
