PROBLEM:


Working with Data Types is very important in the programming world. Here, we will learn to manipulate the basic data types in CPP.
You will be given four different variables of different data types: a (int), b (float), c (double), l (long long), d (string). Your task is to do step-wise operations as given below:
1. Divide b by c.
2. Divide b by a.
3. Divide c by a (cast to int).
4. Add result of step 3 with l.
5. Print the given string, and the 4th (0-based indexing) character of the string both separated by a space.

Input Format:
First line of input conatins number of testcases T. T testcases follow. For each testcase, there will be two lines of input. First line contains a, b, c, and l. Next line contains the string (single word).

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the required output as directed in steps.

Your Task:
Don't worry about the taking input or testcases. Just complete the function dataTypes(int a, float b, double c, long long l,string d)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= a, b, c <= 106
1 <= l <= 1018

Input:
1
1 2 3 5
gfgc

Output:
0.666667 2 3 8
gfgc c

Example:
Testcase 1: a=1, b=2, c=3, l=5, d=gfgc
b/c=0.666667
b/a=2
c/a=3
(c/a)+l=8
d=gfgc
d[3]=c



SOLUTION:



//User function Template for C++

// Function to check and print data types accordingly
void dataTypes(int a, float b, double c, long long l,string d){
    
    // Some statements have been given to you
    // to help you understand data types
    // Please complete the same for correct result
    // Or you can delete and write your own
    float p = b/c ; //do b/c
    
    double q = b/a ; //do b/a
    
    int r =  c/a ; // do c/a
    
    long long m =r+l ;//do r+l
    
    cout << p << " " << q << " " << r <<" "<< m <<endl;
    
    cout << d << " " << d[3] << endl;//write 3 for index

}
